// The software was initially designed for use with Eflite mCP X, but is now adapted to copters/planes in general
//
// The software was inspired by and started from from Bernard Konze's BLMC: http://home.versanet.de/~bkonze/blc_6a/blc_6a.htm
// And also Simon Kirby's TGY: https://github.com/sim-/tgy
//
// This file is best viewed with tab width set to 5
//
// The input signal can be positive 1kHz, 2kHz, 4kHz, 8kHz or 12kHz PWM (e.g. taken from the "resistor tap" on mCPx)
// And the input signal can be PPM (1-2ms) or OneShot125 (125-250us) at rates up to several hundred Hz.
// The code adapts itself to the various input modes/frequencies
// The code ESC can also be to accept inverted input signal.
//
// The first lines of the software must be modified according to the chosen environment:
// Uncomment the selected ESC and main/tail/multi mode
// BESCNO "ESC"_"mode"

// Interrupt handling
// The F330/2 does not disable interrupts when entering an interrupt routine.
// Also some interrupt flags need to be cleared by software
// The code disables interrupts in interrupt routines, in order to avoid too nested interrupts
// - Interrupts are disabled during beeps, to avoid audible interference from interrupts
// - RC pulse interrupts are periodically disabled in order to reduce interference with pwm interrupts.
//
//**** **** **** **** ****
// Motor control:
// - Brushless motor control with 6 states for each electrical 360 degrees
// - An advance timing of 0deg has zero cross 30deg after one commutation and 30deg before the next
// - Timing advance in this implementation is set to 15deg nominally
// - "Damped" commutation schemes are available, where more than one pfet is on when pwm is off. This will absorb energy from bemf and make step settling more damped.
// Motor sequence starting from zero crossing:
// - Timer wait: Wt_Comm			15deg	// Time to wait from zero cross to actual commutation
// - Timer wait: Wt_Advance		15deg	// Time to wait for timing advance. Nominal commutation point is after this
// - Timer wait: Wt_Zc_Scan		7.5deg	// Time to wait before looking for zero cross
// - Scan for zero cross			22.5deg	, Nominal, with some motor variations
//
// Motor startup:
// Startup is the only phase, before normal bemf commutation run begins.
